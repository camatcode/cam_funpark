    - [x] Harness Order for Collections
    - [x] Reverse the Order
    - [x] Reduce Repetitive Code with Macros
        - üìù: It's unwise to drop folks into meta-programming without more detail
    - [x] What We‚Äôve Learned
        - üìù: "Do you fully understand `contramap/1`?" No, in fact, it seems to be an unnecessary complication, but I'm
          pressing forward until I recognize why its useful, or what I can replace it with
- [x] Chapter 4: Combine with Monoids ([work/chapter-4](https://github.com/camatcode/cam_funpark/tree/work/chapter-4))
    - [x] Define the Protocol
    - [x] Combine Numbers with Sum
    - [x] Combine Equality
        - ‚ùì Had to implement `eq_ride` ; did I miss that?
        - üìù: It's at this exact point where it's clear im re-implementing Haskel in Elixir.
    - [x] Combine Order
        - üìù: pg 59: missing a space "default sort forPatrons"
        - ‚ùì Had to implement `ord_by_reward_points` ; did I miss that?
    - [x] Generalize Maximum
        - ‚ùì Had to implement `Ord.Utils.max/3`: did I miss that?
